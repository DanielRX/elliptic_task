## Installation

Please make sure you copy the .env.example file from the root directory to .env and fill in the required values.

In this project, we use infura to get the data we require, so you will need to create an account and get an API key from them.
There are quite a few chains they support, and you can add as many as you like.

Some things we can add in the future:

- Caching
- ENS support
- Past Transactions
- Handling mutiple addresses at once
- Support ENS as input
- Support BTC addresses
- Support L2 chains
- Polling methods
